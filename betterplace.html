              betterplace.org is Germany's largest charity fundraising platform and it's also an NGO itself, meaning it's a not-for-profit organisation.
              For our final project during a UX/UI Design bootcamp at Ironhack, I had the pleasure to work with my class mate - and also now friend 
              - Iara Forstreuter to redesign the betterplace.org destop website. Before even starting the bootcamp, I aspired to work on a project for them
              as I had used their website before and had found some of room for improvement in terms of the UX design and branding. We redesigned the 
              fundraiser event creation flow, specifically with a 'Content Creator' user in mind. We also gave betterplace.org an updated brand identity
              with a new logo, illustrations, and design guide.

            <h3>Logo</h3>
            <p>
              We also re-designed a primary and secondary version of the logo. We wanted to create a brand mark that is simple and accessible by removing the heart shaped
              symbol and making all the letters of the name the same font and size and colour. We chose the letters to be close together and also a blue blob in the background to 
              represent the mission of connectness and support represented by the betterplace.org projects, but wanted the blob to be uneven and unequal - just like humanity can be.

              We designed UI elements that are round, approachable, and easy to read. We also designed a range of default, hover, and active states for project the cards, 
              search filters, project categories, CTA buttons, nav bar menu drop-downs, and account login status.

            <h3>The Brief</h3>
            <p>
              The three core user functions of betterplace.org are to donate, to create a charity project for other users to donate to, or to create a 
              fundraising event to raise donations for a charity of their chosing. Our task was to improve the user flow on the desktop website specifically 
              for Content Creators looking to create a fundraising event. Content Creators are a new target fundraiser group for betterplace.org that they see has a 
              high potential for raising large amounts of donations. The screenshot to the right shows the homescreen of betterplace.org at the time of the start 
              of the project in March 2023.

            <h3>Secondary Research</h3>
            <p>We found in our research that content creators are people who have social media accounts with a follower count ranging from 1,000 to 
              over 1 million. They can be active across a range of social media platforms, which include Instagram, TikTok, Twitter, YouTube, and Facebook.

            <h3>Competitor Analysis</h3>
            <p>
              The main competitors of betterplace.org have similar features, though they have the advantage of intergrated social media sharing options and also easier 
              step-by-step fundraising event creation flows.
            </p>
            <p>
              The visual branding of betterplace.org looks dated and muted compared to it's competitors who use a more contemporary and eye-catching 
              colour palette and imagery which really speaks the language of content creators. The imagery betterplace.org uses on its homepage - although unfortunately the 
              reality of the times we live in - doesn't inspire hope for the user to make a change and donate. The competitors however often use a combination of positive 
              imagery and illustrations which feels empowering and uplifting.

            <h3>User Research</h3>
            <p>
              We conducted five user interviews with content creators in our own networks, with the main goals of understanding how content creators spend their days, 
              how they find out about social causes to support, how they become attracted to fundraise for a social cause, and what might prevent them from particiating in 
              a fundraising event.
            </p>
            <p>We found that content creators need to be able to trust the charity and fundraising platform, that it is a reputable company, and that it's clear where 
              the money is going and the tangiable impact it is having, and what percentage the charity ultimately receives. They feel a social responsibility for their 
              followers and also care about their own repututation. Content creators also are emotionally driven and want to support a charity that speaks to 
              their heart.

              Our research lead us then to identify the key themes that content creators need for them to fundraise for charity:

            <h4>Trust</h4>
            To be able to trust in the fundraising platform and the charity, that they are credible and recognised.
            <h4>Transparency</h4>
            To know exactly where the money is going, what fees there are and why, and how much ends up with the charity.
            <h4>Tangiable impact</h4>
            To know how the charity is spending the money donated and what impact in real-times the money is having.
            <h4>Asthetically-pleasing content</h4>
            To feel proud to share the charity content with their following and for it to feel fitting to their own content.

            <h3>User Persona</h3>
            <p>
              We imagined a user persona for betterplace.org, Atikh Buchle. She's a food and fitness content creator with a following of over 5,000 on Instagram. 
              She's 24, living in Berlin, and interested in dining out, cooking new recipes, yoga and of course keeping up-to-date on social media. She wants to 
              use her influence to help people and to find a cause that touches her heart, and is looking to make an impact with her influence whilst also fostering a 
              sense of community in the process. Though she feels insecure about how the money she fundraises will be spent and so would want to use 
              a trustworthy platform to do so.

            <h3>User Journey</h3>
            <p>
              Almost every part of Atikh's day would revolve around content creation, from taking photos of her smoothie bowl in the morning to when she's at the gym 
              where she would make sure to choose an exercise machine with good lighting. At lunch she would try out a new healthy recipe 
              and again would take photos. Whilst making dinner, she would potentially receive a message from a charity asking her to share one of their posts
              to raise donations. Although she likes the idea of using her influence to help out a charity, she doesn't recognise the charity and so feels insecure about sharing it. 
              Ultimately she decides not to reshare the charity's post, but feels guilty about afterwards and wishes there was a way to feel more secure about sharing fundraising events.

                Content creators who want to use their leverage to make a positive impact need to be able to trust both betterplace.org and the charity they are fundraising for, 
                to see where/who the money is going to, and what tangible impact the money will have because they care about their reputation and the opinions of their audience, and 
                feel a responsibility for the money their audience donates.

                Content creators who want to use their leverage to make a positive impact need to find inspiring and attractive content from betterplace.org because they are

            <h3>New User Flow</h3>
            <p>
              We wanted to make sure that these problems were addressed and improved upon in a new user flow. Though the flow is several steps longer, we wanted to break down the steps into easier more
              managable pages to give the user time to breath and focus on one or two tasks at a time, inspired by the flow we had seen in the competitors websites.

            <h3>Low-Fi Prototype</h3>
            <p>
              Using this user flow, we began to sketch out some wireframe designs for the desktop website, whilst also including initial sketches of the ideas we had decided 
              on in the feature prioritisation matrix. We were influenced by the GoFundMe design for filtering the projects, as we particularly liked the simplicity and structure 
              of the pages that guide the user through the several project filter options and also setting up the fundraising event. We only had time to test the paper prototype 
              with one user as we felt pressed for time, and unfortunately the test wasn't so insightful. In hindsight, we could've tested the prototype more at this stage, 
              especially since we had increased the length of the user flow.

            <h3>Mid-Fi Prototype</h3>
            <p>
              We translated the paper sketches to Mid-Fi wireframes in Figma. We broke down the event creation steps even further as we recognised that both the project 
              filter screen and the event naming screens appeared quite cluttered on the paper prototype. 
            </p>
            <p>
              When testing the Mid-Fi prototype, we had the feedback that the flow felt understandable and easy, and people liked how easy it was. The test users found that they initially clicked
              on the "start a fundraiser" button on the homescreen first, instead of clicking "fundraisers" in the nav bar menu to navigate to the landing page specific for content 
              creaters as we had prototyped. To resolve this, we designed an additional flow where the user could additionally click on "start a fundraiser" and then would be 
              guided to a separate screen with the option to choose the type of fundraiser they are as "content creator", before then joining back to the original content creator 
              fundraiser event creation flow. The test users wanted more feedback on the social media sharing page to clearly indicate when the event had been shared, so we designed 
              a check box to appear once it had been shared and also for the "next" button to only appear once the event had been successfully shared.

            <h3>Brand Attributes</h3>
            <p>
              We then moved onto thinking about the brand attributes for the rebrand. The existing betterplace.org brand attributes are "Trustworthy", "Transparency", 
            "Easy", and "Empowering". We decided to keep both "Trustworthy" and "Empowering" as we thought they were reflected well in our user research, and additionally included
            "Hopeful" to emphasise the need for positive imagery and language thoughout the design.

            <h3>Moodboard</h3>
            <p>
              We created a moodboard with references to reflect these brand attributes of "Hope", "Trustworthy" and "Empowering". We chose images of hands to show community and 
              the togetherness of the people involved in the fundraising campaigns. We chose a colour palette of shades of light to mid blue, yellow green, dark green and pops of orange.
              The majority of the design would be blues and dark greens create a feeling of security and safety, whilst pops of the yellow green and orange bring a hopeful and joyful warmth
              to the design. We chose references for the typography that are sans serif, wide and rounded to again convey trust and also easy to read and not distracting from the the core 
              fundraising and donating functions of the website.

            <p>
              When we tested the moodboard with a user survey, the highest scoring attributes reflected those of our chosen brand attributes which we were happy to see. This gave us
              confidence to then move ahead to designing the Hi-Fi prototype.

              <p>
                We presented the research and hi-fi prototype to the UX Designer at betterplace.org, gathered our thoughts on our learnings from the project and what we would do next
                had we had longer than two weeks.
              </p>
            </div>
            <div class="col-12 col-sm-12 col-md-12 col-xl-9 gx-5 gy-5">
              <p>
                The UX Designer at betterplace.org gave us the feedback that she really liked the design. 
                Though it won't be possible to implement the design at the time due to limited engineering capicities at betterplace.org, she found the user research 
                to be really valuable, and the ideas and features we came up with she will be sure to test out in her future work, and will let us know if any of the designs 
                are implemented into the website in the next years once the engineering capacities are increased.
              </p>
              <p>
                Had we had more than two weeks for the project, we would love to have done more user testing at all stages of the prototyping to understand the feedback from users, 
                and whether our design solved our problem statements. We also would have loved to have included a section on the content creator landing page with a 
                simple overview of freelancer bureaucratic information and also further visualise how fundraising donations become real tangiable results, 
                as these themes came up several times during our user research.
              </p>
              <p>
                We learned a lot during this two week student project, mainly client expectation management as there seemed to be some confusion about how much involvement
                the client would have during the school project, which we addressed during the project and also in a feedback meeting after presenting the design to 
                betterplace.org. We also defined our own goals as the initial project brief was just to map out the existing user journey for content creators and companies, 
                which we then suggested we could actually focus on just one user content creators and do more for them by redesigning the whole betterplace.org branding as well as the 
                user flow for content creator fundraising events. Lastly we also learnt how useful it is to priorise the many ideas we had using a feature prioritisation matrix, which helped us focus on only the most
                important and urgent ideas.
